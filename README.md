## Overview

`gbm`---which stands for gradient boosted models---implements extensions to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting machine. It includes regression methods for least squares, absolute loss, t-distribution loss, quantile regression, logistic, multinomial logistic, Poisson, Cox proportional hazards partial likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss, Huberized hinge loss, and Learning to Rank measures (i.e., LambdaMart).

**Note:** This is a maintained version of `gbm` back compatible to CRAN versions of `gbm` 2.1.x, mainly for the purpose of reproducible research and data analyses performed with the 2.1.x versions of `gbm`. For newer development, and a more consistent API, try out the newer [gbm3](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm3) package!
